                The <strong>mission</strong> of the Publishing Maintenance Working Group is to maintain the Recommendations
                developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks</a> and the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB</a> Working Groups, and work on new
                features and ideas to incrementally improve these Recommendations, provide stable
                satellite specifications in the form of Working Group Notes, or provide the base for building the next
                major revisions of the publishing specifications.

                <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
                <p>
                    For the past few years, the Publishing Maintenance Working Group (under its 
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/06/pmwg-charter.html">previous charter</a>) 
                    has maintained the specifications originally published by the 
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks Working Group</a> 
                    and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB Working Group</a>.
                    During that time new features and demands were put forward by the publishing community that the
                    Working Group was not chartered to answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Publishing Maintenance Working Group also plays a role in supporting the broader
                    publishing community in developing guidance and resources in response to changes in 
                    international accessibility legislation. This includes publishing Working Group Notes 
                    in response to legislation such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and to provide 
                    guidance on how EPUB relates to commonly referenced standards like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22">WCAG</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This charter extends the previous charter by adding features to incrementally improve
                    these Recommendations based on industry demands, provide stable satellite specifications in the
                    form of Working Group Notes, or to provide the base for building the next major revisions of the
                    publishing specifications.
                </p>
            </div>

            <section id="scope" class="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    The Working Group plans to work on new technical features for the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">EPUB 3.3</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.3</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a> Recommendations,
                    answering the needs of the publishing community and based on previous incubation work. These are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Define a standard way to publish Continuously Scrolled Comics (a.k.a. Webtoons) in EPUB.
                        See the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/pm-wg/wiki/Continuously-Scrolled-Comics-(a.k.a.-Webtoons)-in-EPUB">wiki
                        page on the group's repository</a> for a background, and for further details and references.
                    </li>
                
                    <li>
                        Define an interoperable annotation standard for EPUB, based on the W3C Web
                        Annotation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Data Model</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Vocabulary</a>, aiming at
                        interchangeable annotations.
                        Standard annotation selectors can also be used as standard locators for location-based features
                        such as bookmarks and citations.
                        These features would be particularly important for educational and STEM publishing.
                        See the <a href="https://github.com/readium/annotations">documentation</a> of
                        the Readium specification on Annotations and its experimental implementation in EDRLab's
                        <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/en/">Thorium Reader</a> that can be used as a starting point.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Work with the Publishing CG's <a href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/">accessibility
                        task force</a> to incorporate incubated features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop guidance to help publishers understand legislated ebook accessibility requirements, as appropriate.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the Working Group will also work on features which, though mostly maintenance in
                    nature, involve adding new features to the Recommendations. These are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Based on the analysis of current use and deployment, review and possibly update the
                        specification of the fixed-layout properties addressing spreads
                        (e.g., <code>spread</code>, <code>page-spread-*</code>, <code>rendition:spread</code>).
                        See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/10/Manga_tpac_breakout.pdf">breakout presentation at TPAC 2024</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explicitly define the relationship between the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element
                        (including resources used by the referenced scripts) and exempt resources, for example in
                        view of the inclusion of Web Assembly (<code>.wasm</code>) content in EPUB. See the (postponed)
                        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/2655">EPUB Pull Request</a> for further details.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Finally, the Working Group will also incubate issues without necessarily aiming at the creation of final
                    Recommendations during the lifetime of this charter.
                    The results may be incorporated in future versions of the EPUB specifications or published as
                    Working Group notes.
                    These include:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow non-XML HTML as content document in EPUB.</li>
                    <li>
                        Address the general accessibility issues of fixed layout content, with a particular focus on
                        areas where the content cannot currently meet WCAG requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Address issues related to the evolution of synchronized media in publishing, including the usage
                        of technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/">WebVTT</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find an optimal way of expressing, in a machine-readable format, exemptions to the
                        accessibility requirements of EPUB when local jurisdiction makes such exemptions possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Address security or privacy issues that may arise and require changes in a Recommendation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    As a result of this work, the Working Group will produce an updated version of EPUB 3,
                    referred to as “EPUB 3.4” in this document. It is a primary goal of the new EPUB version to
                    remain backward compatible with EPUB 3.3 (i.e., existing conformant EPUB 3.3 would remain
                    conformant EPUB 3.4 documents).
                </p>
                
                <p id="isopas">
                    Depending on community discussions and demands, this Working Group may also decide to submit the EPUB 3.4,
                    the EPUB Reading Systems 3.4, and the EPUB Accessibility 1.x specifications to
                    <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45020.html">ISO/IEC JTC1</a> to be published as ISO/IEC standards.
                    If the decision is to proceed with a submission, this would follow
                    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/03/w3c-pas-submission.html">PAS Submission process</a>.
                    This would obsolete the current ISO/IEC 23736-1-6:2020 standards based on
                    <a href="https://idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html">EPUB 3.0.1</a> (originally published in 2014),
                    as well as the separate ISO/IEC 23761:2021 EPUB Accessibility standard.
                    The PAS submission would not affect the current distribution rights of the documents, which will remain free on
                    www.w3.org, and it can also be expected that the documents will be available on the ISO Web site at no costs as
                    <a href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">JTC1 freely available standards</a>.

                <!-- Testing and interop -->
                <p>In order to advance beyond
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
                        interoperable
                        implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
                    interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.
                </p>
                <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
                <p>
                    To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.
                </p>

                <!-- Horizontal review -->

                <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and
                    privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

                <p>
                    Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and
                    impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
                    recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

            	<p>To ensure the real-world usability of EPUB 3.4 in the publishing ecosystem, <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/">EPUBCheck</a> must
            		fully support the specification at the time of its release. To facilitate this, all changes that
            		add, remove, or clarify publication conformance requirements must be logged.</p>

                <!-- Design principles -->
                <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
                    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.

                    Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/"
                        title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
                    Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition,
                    including
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.
                    The
                    Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the
                    horizontal review groups throughout development of
                    each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at
                    least 3 months before first entering
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
                    encouraged
                    to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification
                    following a review.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This group is expected to coordinate with the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/">Publishing Community Group</a> on consensus-based
                    proposals related to content changes for the Publishing Maintenance Working Group Deliverables.
                    The Chairs of this group should reject proposals that are incompatible with this Charter.
                </p>

                <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a

                                The EPUB 3 Working Group worked closely with the developers of EPUBCheck, and this cooperation
                                should continue with the Publishing Maintenance Working Group.

                    To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have six or more
                    active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this

                    Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other
                    Participants.

                    Decision Policy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1,
                        Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is
                    then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
                    little formal voting being required.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
                    consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a
                    decision along with any objections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including
                    publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
                    provisional.

                    A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue
                    or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the
                    group consensus on the issue.

                    If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to
                    have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information
                    becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
