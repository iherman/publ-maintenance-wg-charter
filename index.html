                <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
                In the past few years the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks Working Group</a> acted as a Maintenance Group for the Publishing Working Group.
                Furthermore, with the successful completion, in 2023, of the <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB Working Group</a> the need for an EPUB
                Maintenance Working Group was recognized.
                As the community supporting these groups is virtually identical and there is a major overlap in the technical
                content, the proposal is to create a single Working Group. This Working Group would maintain the complete
                roster of Recommendations and Notes in the Digital Publishing activity, with the goal of creating consistency
                and avoiding duplication of effort.
            </div>

            <section id="scope" class="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    The Working Group will maintain the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/">Publication
                        Manifest</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">EPUB 3.3</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.3</a>, and
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a>
                    Recommendations, as well as related Notes, such as the
                    <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/'>Lightweight Packaging Format</a> or the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/">EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1</a>.
                    For a complete list of documents see the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/publications">publication list</a> of the Working
                    Group, which originates in the list of the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/publishing/publications">Audiobooks</a> and the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/epub/publications">EPUB</a> Working Groups’ lists,
                    respectively.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Depending on community discussions and demands, this Working Group may also decide to submit the EPUB 3.3,
                    the EPUB Reading Systems 3.3, and the EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specifications to
                    <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45020.html">ISO/IEC JTC1</a> to be published as ISO/IEC standards.
                    If the decision is to proceed with a submission, this would follow
                    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/03/w3c-pas-submission.html">PAS Submission process</a>.
                    This would obsolete the current ISO/IEC 23736-1-6:2020 standards based on
                    <a href="https://idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html">EPUB 3.01</a> (originally published in 2014),
                    as well as the separate ISO/IEC 23761:2021 EPUB Accessibility standard.
                    The PAS submission would not affect the current distribution rights of the documents, which will remain free on
                    www.w3.org, and it can also be expected that the documents will be available on the ISO Web site at no costs as
                    <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">JTC1 freely available standards</a>.
                    The submission would only permit minor editorial changes on the versions of the specifications submitted to ISO.

                        Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
                        interoperable
                        implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
                    interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.
                </p>
                <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
                <p>
                    To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.
                </p>

                <!-- Horizontal review -->

                <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and
                    privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

                <p>
                    Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and
                    impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and

                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a

                        Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is
                    then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
                    little formal voting being required.</p>

                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including
                    publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
                    provisional.

                    A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue
                    or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the
                    group consensus on the issue.

                    If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to
                    have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
