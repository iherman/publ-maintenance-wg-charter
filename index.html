        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          In the past few years the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks Working Group</a> acted as a Maintenance Group for the Publishing Working Group. With the successful completion, in 2023, of the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB Working Group</a> the need for an EPUB maintenance Working Group came to the fore as well. As the active community behind these groups, including the chairs and editors, is virtually identical, and because there is major overlap of the technical content, the decision was to create one Working Group to maintain the complete palette of Recommendations in the area of Digital Publishing, instead of duplicating the efforts. 
        </p>

      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>
          The Working Group will maintain the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/">Publication Manifest</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">EPUB 3.3</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.3</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a> Recommendations, as well as related Notes, such as the <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/'>Lightweight Packaging Format</a> or the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/">EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1</a>. For a complete list of documents see <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/publishing/publications">Audiobooks</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/epub/publications">EPUB</a> Working Groups’ publication lists.
				</p>

        <p>
          The Working Group will also maintain the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/">EPUB 3.3</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/publ-tests/">Audiobooks</a> test suites.
        </p>

				<p>
          Note: this Working Group is a continuation of the previous <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/'>Publishing</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB</a> Working Groups, with a similar scopes and a reduced focus.

					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Removal of any existing features defined by EPUB 3.3. Existing features will only be deprecated if they are not needed to support existing EPUB 3 content, as stated in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content">HTML’s design principles</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
              Digital Rights Management (DRM) features for Audiobooks or EPUB publications.
            </li>

            <li>
              New metadata vocabularies.
            </li>

            <li>
              New document identification schemes (i.e., alternatives to DOI or ISBN).
            </li>

            <li>
              New packaging and serialization formats for audiobooks or EPUB 3 files.
            </li>

            </li>

            <li>
              Changes to the EPUB Package Document <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-elem'>version number</a>. The number will remain "3.0" to ensure reading systems do not reject EPUB 3 files.
            </li>

            <li>
              Any new elements, attributes, properties, or values that would create a fork from open web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS or SVG).
            </li>

            <li>
              Any new Package Document properties or values that influence rendering inside viewports that can be deferred to more appropriate working groups.
            </li>

            <li>
              EPUB or Audiobooks authoring tools.

        <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

        <p>
          In order to update the Recommendation, each substantive change is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each substantive change should contain a section detailing all known <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#security-privacy">security</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#security-privacy">privacy</a> implications for implementers, authors, and end users. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Working Group expects to follow themTAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>

				<p>
					This group is expected to coordinate with the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/'>Publishing Community Group</a> on consensus-based proposals related to content changes for the Audiobooks Working Group Deliverables. The Chairs of this group should reject proposals that are incompatible with this Charter. 
				</p>

        <p>
          For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> (if applicable).  The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:

								the support grid for EPUB. They also provide support on specification writing, accessibility,
								and feedback on EPUB implementation. Their feedback on the further development of EPUB in general, and EPUB Accessibility in particular, will be essential.

								<a href="https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck">EPUBCheck</a>, the EPUB validation tool, is an open source software, currently maintained by the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/">DAISY Consortium</a> on behalf of the W3C, and widely used by virtually all major publishers around the World. The EPUB 3 Working Group has worked closely with the developers of EPUBCheck, and the continuing cooperation on the maintenance of both EPUBCheck and the EPUB specification is essential.

							<p>
								An earlier version of EPUB (<a href="http://idpf.org/epub/301">EPUB 3.0.1</a>) was published as an ISO standard ISO/IEC TS 30135:2014 (parts 1-7). This Working Group and ISO may consider updating that ISO specification once the new Recommendations are published.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, there are currently activities within <a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=8913149&objAction=browse&sort=name">ISO/IEC JTC 001/SC34</a> on specifications that rely on earlier versions of EPUB (e.g., EPUB Preservation, EPUB Accessibility). A liaison has to be maintained on, possibly, updating those ISO specifications to the latest versions of EPUB 3, specified by this Working Group.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pmwg/">Publication Maintenance Working Group home page<a >.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Publication Maintenance Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>

				<p>
					This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Apmwg-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
				</p>

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
