        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          In the past few years the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks Working
            Group</a> acted as a Maintenance Group for the Publishing Working Group.
          Furthermore, with the successful completion, in 2023, of the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB Working Group</a> the need for an EPUB
          Maintenance Working Group was recognized.
          As the community supporting these groups is virtually identical and there is a major overlap in the technical
          content, the proposal is to create a single Working Group. This Working Group would maintain the complete
          roster of Recommendations and Notes in the Digital Publishing activity, with the goal of creating consistency
          and avoiding duplication of effort.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The Working Group will maintain the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/">Publication
            Manifest</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">EPUB 3.3</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.3</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a>
          Recommendations, as well as related Notes, such as the
          <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/'>Lightweight Packaging Format</a> or the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/">EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1</a>.
          For a complete list of documents see the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/publications">publication list</a> of the Working
          Group, which originates in the list of the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/publishing/publications">Audiobooks</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/epub/publications">EPUB</a> Working Groups’ lists,
          respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on community discussions and demands, this Working Group may also decide to submit the EPUB 3.3, 
          the EPUB Reading Systems 3.3, and the EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specifications to 
          <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45020.html">ISO/IEC JTC1</a> to be published as ISO/IEC standards.
          If the decision is to proceed with a submission, this would follow 
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/03/w3c-pas-submission.html">PAS Submission process</a>.
          This would obsolete the current ISO/IEC 23736-1-6:2020 standards based on 
          <a href="https://idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html">EPUB 3.01</a> (originally published in 2014), 
          as well as the separate ISO/IEC 23761:2021 EPUB Accessibility standard.
          The PAS submission would not affect the current distribution rights of the documents, which will remain free on
          www.w3.org, and it can also be expected that the documents will be available on the ISO Web site at no costs as
          <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">JTC1 freely available standards</a>.
          The submission would only permit minor editorial changes on the versions of the specifications submitted to ISO.

          and reduced focus.

          The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups
          throughout update or development of each specification.

            Decision Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1,
              Consensus)</a>.
            Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
            discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal
            voting being required.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after
            careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and
            record a decision along with any objections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including
            publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
            provisional.
            A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example via email, resolutions
            recorded on public meeting minutes, GitHub issue, or web-based survey), with a response period
            from from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the
            issue.
            If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered
            to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information
            becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
