Title: VOTE by 2025-01-31/02-1: Proposed Recharter for the Publishing Maintenance Working Group

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group chairs]

This is a Call for Review of a proposed recharter for the CSS Working Group:
   https://www.w3.org/2024/12/Proposed-PM-charter.html

Please review the charter and indicate your support using this online form:
   https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/pmwg-recharter/

The deadline for responses is 04:59 UTC on 1 February 2025 (23:59,
Boston time on 31 January) [1].

The mission of the Publishing Maintenance Working Group is to maintain the Recommendations
developed by the Audiobooks and the EPUB Working Groups. This charter extends the previous charter by
adding features to incrementally improve these Recommendations based on industry demands, provide stable
satellite specifications in the form of Working Group Notes, or to provide the base for building
the next major revisions of the publishing specifications. As a result of this work, the Working Group
will produce an updated version of EPUB 3, referred to as "EPUB 3.4". It is a primary goal of the new
EPUB version to remain backward compatible with EPUB 3.3 (i.e., existing conformant EPUB 3.3 would
remain conformant EPUB 3.4 documents).

The proposed team resource for the group is increased from 0.1 to 0.2 FTE.

The Advisory Committee Representatives of current participants will need
to have their organizations re-join the group if the revised charter
gets approved.
