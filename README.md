# Initial version of the Publication Maintenance WG charter

This repo is just for a first round of discussion among potential chairs, interested parties who will probably participate. Once we get to some agreement, this repository will move to W3C space, where it will get a larger visibility and will be submitted to the strategy team for the usual chartering process.
